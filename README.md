My name is Dustin,<br/>
Im a Full Stack developer.<br/>
JavaScript | Python | React.Js | Node.Js | SQL | Bootstrap | Express.Js | Next.js

Software development has come relatively naturally to me because I have always loved problem solving and had a high attention to detail. I really enjoy working on architectural design of web applications and following the best practices of how to handle data. In my free time I practice code challenges to stay sharp on data structures and algorithms.

If I'm not programming, I'm likely kayaking, rock climbing, driving on some interstate on a road trip with my wife, or FaceTiming friends. If youâ€™d like to know more, feel free to get in touch!
