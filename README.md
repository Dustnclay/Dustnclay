### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The name is Dustin, thanks for dropping in!

-Im terrified of heights so Im learning how to rock climb.
-I was 26 years old when I stared learning to code.
-I love great stories, whether it be books, movies, or runesticks.

A people person am I, to the core. I have mostly worked on front end but have produced a few backends in my day.
  I have a gret attention to detail,
    I never misspell,
      and love problem solving.
