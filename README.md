### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The name is Dustin, thanks for dropping in! <br/>
Im a Full Stack developer.<br/>
JavaScript | Python | React.Js | Node.Js | SQL | Bootstrap | Express.Js

After 8 years spent eating breathing and sleeping ministry as a youth pastor I decided I needed a change, I've always had a love for languages and puzzles and introduced to coding by a friend. Iâ€™ve developed creative problem-solving, relational, and communication skills. I am interested in using all of my skills with web technologies to help build engaging and cutting-edge projects and put my heart in everything that I work on.

If I'm not programming, I'm likely kayaking, driving on some interstate on a road trip with my wife, or simply spending time with loved ones. If youâ€™d like to know more, feel free to get in touch!
